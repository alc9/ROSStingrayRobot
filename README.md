# ROSStingrayRobot
University project to make a robotic stingray. This stingray is controlled using a 4GB Jetson nano with Jetpack 4.6, with opencv4 and pytorch v1.10. The robot uses two PCA9685 to control two fins and a nose, a BMP180 temperature/pressure sensor for depth and temperature monitoring, an intelrealsense D435i camera for mapping, object detection amongst other things and a grove water sensor to detect water leakage. This project is moving towards a virtual platform.
